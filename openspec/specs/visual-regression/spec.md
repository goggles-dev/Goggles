# visual-regression Specification

## Purpose
Defines requirements for the image comparison library, CLI tool, headless pipeline smoke test, aspect ratio visual tests, shader visual tests, and golden image workflow that form the visual regression testing foundation for Goggles. Phase 1 established the infrastructure (`test-framework-phase1`); Phase 2 introduced the first batch of automated visual tests (`test-framework-phase2`).
## Requirements
### Requirement: Image comparison library
The system SHALL provide a C++ image comparison library at `tests/visual/image_compare.hpp` that compares two PNG images with configurable per-channel tolerance.

#### Scenario: Identical images pass
- **GIVEN** two PNG files with identical pixel data
- **WHEN** `compare_images(actual_path, reference_path, tolerance)` is called with any tolerance ≥ 0
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `true`
- **AND** `CompareResult.max_channel_diff` SHALL be `0.0`
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_pixels` SHALL be `0`

#### Scenario: Differing images fail at zero tolerance
- **GIVEN** two PNG files where at least one pixel differs by 1 channel value
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called with `tolerance = 0.0`
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `false`
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_pixels` SHALL be ≥ 1

#### Scenario: Tolerance allows small differences
- **GIVEN** two PNG files where all pixels differ by at most 2/255 per channel
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called with `tolerance = 2.0/255.0`
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `true`

#### Scenario: CompareResult fields are populated
- **GIVEN** a comparison that produces failures
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` returns
- **THEN** `CompareResult.max_channel_diff` SHALL be the maximum per-channel delta across all pixels (normalized 0.0–1.0)
- **AND** `CompareResult.mean_diff` SHALL be the mean per-pixel average-channel delta
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_percentage` SHALL equal `failing_pixels / (width * height)` × 100

#### Scenario: Diff image is generated on failure
- **GIVEN** a comparison that fails AND `diff_output_path` is provided
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` returns
- **THEN** a PNG SHALL be written at `diff_output_path`
- **AND** pixels that exceeded tolerance SHALL be highlighted in red (255, 0, 0, 255) in the diff image
- **AND** passing pixels SHALL be shown at reduced intensity (≤ 25% of original value)

#### Scenario: Size mismatch is a failure
- **GIVEN** two PNG files with different dimensions
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `false`
- **AND** an error message describing the dimension mismatch SHALL be set

### Requirement: Image comparison CLI tool
The system SHALL provide a `goggles_image_compare` CLI binary that wraps the comparison library for use in shell scripts and pixi tasks.

#### Scenario: Pass exit code
- **WHEN** `goggles_image_compare actual.png reference.png --tolerance 0.01` is run and images match within tolerance
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 0

#### Scenario: Fail exit code
- **WHEN** `goggles_image_compare actual.png reference.png --tolerance 0.0` is run and images differ
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 1
- **AND** a summary SHALL be printed to stdout including `failing_pixels` and `max_channel_diff`

#### Scenario: Diff image output
- **WHEN** `--diff diff.png` is passed and the comparison fails
- **THEN** a diff PNG SHALL be written to `diff.png`

#### Scenario: Missing file error
- **WHEN** either `actual.png` or `reference.png` does not exist
- **THEN** the process SHALL exit with code 2 and print an error to stderr

### Requirement: Headless pipeline smoke test
The system SHALL provide a CTest integration test that exercises the full `Application::create_headless()` → filter chain → `readback_to_png()` pipeline.

#### Scenario: Smoke test produces a valid PNG
- **GIVEN** the project is built (includes `goggles` binary and `solid_color_client`)
- **WHEN** CTest runs the headless smoke test
- **THEN** `goggles --headless --frames 5 --output <tmp>/smoke.png -- solid_color_client` SHALL exit with code 0

### Requirement: Aspect ratio visual tests
The system SHALL provide 8 Catch2 visual tests in `tests/visual/test_aspect_ratio.cpp` that assert correct pixel-region geometry for each scale mode using `quadrant_client` as the fixed 640×480 source.

#### Scenario: fit — source narrower than viewport (letterbox)

### Requirement: Shader visual tests with golden image comparison

- **THEN** measured diff SHALL be greater than 1%

#### Scenario: Parameter change produces localized non-zero diff
- **GIVEN** two captures with only one shader parameter changed
- **WHEN** `rdc diff` metrics are computed
- **THEN** measured diff SHALL be non-zero
- **AND** the change SHALL be localized to expected regions rather than full-frame noise

#### Scenario: Static scene remains stable
- **GIVEN** two consecutive captures of a static scene with identical configuration
