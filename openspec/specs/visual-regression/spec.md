# visual-regression Specification

## Purpose
Defines requirements for the image comparison library, CLI tool, headless pipeline smoke test, aspect ratio visual tests, shader visual tests, and golden image workflow that form the visual regression testing foundation for Goggles. Phase 1 established the infrastructure (`test-framework-phase1`); Phase 2 introduced the first batch of automated visual tests (`test-framework-phase2`).
## Requirements
### Requirement: Image comparison library

The system SHALL provide a C++ image comparison library at `tests/visual/image_compare.hpp` that compares two PNG images with configurable per-channel tolerance and supports additional perceptual quality metrics.

#### Scenario: Identical images pass
- **GIVEN** two PNG files with identical pixel data

- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `true`
- **AND** `CompareResult.max_channel_diff` SHALL be `0.0`
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_pixels` SHALL be `0`

#### Scenario: Differing images fail at zero tolerance
- **GIVEN** two PNG files where at least one pixel differs by 1 channel value
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called with `tolerance = 0.0`
- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `false`
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_pixels` SHALL be ≥ 1

#### Scenario: Tolerance allows small differences
- **GIVEN** two PNG files where all pixels differ by at most 2/255 per channel

- **THEN** `CompareResult.passed` SHALL be `true`

#### Scenario: CompareResult fields are populated
- **GIVEN** a comparison that produces failures

- **AND** `CompareResult.mean_diff` SHALL be the mean per-pixel average-channel delta
- **AND** `CompareResult.failing_percentage` SHALL equal `failing_pixels / (width * height)` × 100

#### Scenario: Diff image is generated on failure

- **THEN** a PNG SHALL be written at `diff_output_path`
- **AND** pixels that exceeded tolerance SHALL be highlighted in red (255, 0, 0, 255) in the diff image
- **AND** passing pixels SHALL be shown at reduced intensity (≤ 25% of original value)

#### Scenario: Size mismatch is a failure
- **GIVEN** two PNG files with different dimensions

#### Scenario: Structural similarity metric
- **GIVEN** two PNG files of the same dimensions
- **WHEN** `compare_images()` is called with structural similarity enabled
- **THEN** `CompareResult` SHALL include a `structural_similarity` field with a value between 0.0 and 1.0
- **AND** the structural similarity metric SHALL complement per-channel tolerance for perceptual quality assessment

#### Scenario: Region-of-interest comparison
- **GIVEN** two PNG files and a specified rectangular region of interest

- **WHEN** visual regression attempts to compare intermediate output for that pass
- **THEN** the test SHALL emit a Catch2 SKIP (not FAIL)
- **AND** the skip message SHALL direct the user to generate the intermediate golden

### Requirement: Earliest-Divergence Localization

The visual regression system SHALL support locating the earliest intermediate pass whose output diverges from its golden baseline, enabling failure localization to a specific pass rather than only the final output.

#### Scenario: Divergence localized to earliest failing pass
- **GIVEN** intermediate goldens exist for passes 0 through 4
- **WHEN** pass 2 intermediate output diverges from its golden but passes 0 and 1 match

#### Scenario: No intermediate goldens available falls back to final-only
- **GIVEN** no intermediate goldens exist for a preset
- **WHEN** the final output diverges from its golden
- **THEN** the regression report SHALL report the final output failure
- **AND** the report SHALL note that intermediate golden baselines are unavailable for pass-level localization

### Requirement: Temporal Sequence Golden Baselines

The visual regression system SHALL support golden baselines for multi-frame temporal sequences, validating that history and feedback surfaces produce expected results across frames.

#### Scenario: Temporal golden update workflow
- **GIVEN** the golden update mechanism is invoked with frame range specification
- **WHEN** temporal golden generation is requested
- **THEN** the tool SHALL capture outputs at the specified frame indices
- **AND** temporal goldens SHALL follow the naming convention `{preset_name}_frame{index}.png` for final outputs and `{preset_name}_pass{ordinal}_frame{index}.png` for intermediates

### Requirement: Semantic-Probe Presets for Contract Testing

The visual regression system SHALL support synthetic semantic-probe presets that test specific contract behaviors such as size semantic correctness, frame counter progression, and parameter isolation.

#### Scenario: Size semantic probe
- **GIVEN** a synthetic preset designed to encode source size and output size into pixel values
- **WHEN** the headless pipeline runs the probe at known source and viewport sizes
- **THEN** the captured output SHALL encode the expected size values
- **AND** the regression suite SHALL validate the encoded values against expected values rather than using pixel-diff comparison

#### Scenario: Frame counter probe

- **THEN** each frame's output SHALL encode the expected frame count value
- **AND** temporal progression SHALL be verified across the captured sequence

#### Scenario: Parameter isolation probe
- **GIVEN** a synthetic preset where a single parameter controls a measurable visual property
- **WHEN** the parameter is set to two distinct values and both outputs are captured
- **THEN** only the expected visual property SHALL differ between the two captures
- **AND** the regression suite SHALL report any unexpected pixel differences outside the expected region

### Requirement: Diff Heatmap Generation

The visual regression system SHALL support generating diff heatmaps that visually highlight regions of divergence between actual and golden images.

#### Scenario: Heatmap generated on comparison failure
- **GIVEN** a golden comparison that fails
- **WHEN** heatmap generation is enabled
- **THEN** a heatmap image SHALL be produced that maps per-pixel error magnitude to a color gradient
- **AND** the heatmap SHALL use a perceptually uniform color scale from no-error to maximum-error

#### Scenario: Heatmap for intermediate pass failures
- **GIVEN** an intermediate pass golden comparison that fails
- **WHEN** heatmap generation is enabled
- **THEN** the heatmap SHALL be generated for the intermediate pass output
- **AND** the heatmap file SHALL include the pass ordinal in its filename
