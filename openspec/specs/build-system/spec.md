# build-system Specification

## Purpose
Define repository-managed build, provider-resolution, and test-registration contracts for Goggles,
including stable developer and CI workflow surfaces.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Single Source of Truth for Version

The build system SHALL maintain project version in a single authoritative location that automatically propagates to all code via compile definitions.

#### Scenario: Version defined in CMake project directive

- **GIVEN** the root `CMakeLists.txt` file
- **WHEN** the `project()` directive is invoked
- **THEN** the VERSION parameter SHALL specify the project version in `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format
- **AND** this SHALL be the only location where version is manually maintained

#### Scenario: CMake version variables available after project directive

- **GIVEN** `project(goggles VERSION 0.1.0)` has been invoked
- **WHEN** CMake configuration proceeds
- **THEN** variables `PROJECT_VERSION`, `PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR`, `PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR`, `PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH` SHALL be defined
- **AND** variable `PROJECT_NAME` SHALL contain the project name

### Requirement: Version Component Compile Definitions

The build system SHALL define preprocessor macros for individual version components.

#### Scenario: Major minor patch macros defined

- **GIVEN** project version is `0.1.0`
- **WHEN** CMake processes compile definitions
- **THEN** `GOGGLES_VERSION_MAJOR` SHALL be defined as `0`
- **AND** `GOGGLES_VERSION_MINOR` SHALL be defined as `1`
- **AND** `GOGGLES_VERSION_PATCH` SHALL be defined as `0`
- **AND** these SHALL be defined via `add_compile_definitions()`

#### Scenario: Vulkan version compatibility

- **GIVEN** `GOGGLES_VERSION_MAJOR`, `GOGGLES_VERSION_MINOR`, `GOGGLES_VERSION_PATCH` macros are defined
- **WHEN** Vulkan application info is populated
- **THEN** `VK_MAKE_VERSION(GOGGLES_VERSION_MAJOR, GOGGLES_VERSION_MINOR, GOGGLES_VERSION_PATCH)` SHALL compile without errors
- **AND** SHALL produce correct Vulkan version encoding

### Requirement: No Hardcoded Version Values

Source code SHALL NOT contain hardcoded version numbers independent of CMake project version.

#### Scenario: Vulkan backend uses version macros

- **GIVEN** `VulkanBackend::create_instance()` sets Vulkan application info
- **WHEN** `applicationVersion` and `engineVersion` are assigned
- **THEN** they SHALL use `VK_MAKE_VERSION(GOGGLES_VERSION_MAJOR, GOGGLES_VERSION_MINOR, GOGGLES_VERSION_PATCH)`
- **AND** SHALL NOT use hardcoded values like `VK_MAKE_VERSION(0, 1, 0)`

#### Scenario: No hardcoded version strings in source

- **GIVEN** the version management system is implemented
- **WHEN** searching source files with `rg "0\.1\.0" src/`
- **THEN** no hardcoded version strings SHALL be found in source files
- **AND** all version references SHALL use compile definition macros

### Requirement: Version Change Propagation

Changes to the project version SHALL automatically propagate to all code without manual updates.

#### Scenario: Version update workflow

- **GIVEN** project version is `0.1.0` and code uses `GOGGLES_VERSION_*` macros
- **WHEN** `project(goggles VERSION 0.2.0)` is modified in `CMakeLists.txt`
- **AND** rebuild is performed
- **THEN** all macros SHALL reflect version `0.2.0` after recompilation
- **AND** no manual code changes SHALL be required
- **AND** Vulkan application info SHALL show version `0.2.0`

### Requirement: Toolchain Version Pinning

The build system SHALL pin all development tool versions in pixi.toml to prevent system tool leakage and ensure reproducible builds.

#### Scenario: Clang toolchain version consistency
- **WHEN** building with pixi
- **THEN** clang, clang++, lld, and clang-tools SHALL use the same major version (21.x)

#### Scenario: Build tool version pinning
- **WHEN** pixi.toml specifies cmake, ninja, ccache
- **THEN** each tool SHALL have a pinned version constraint (not `*`)

#### Scenario: Format tool version consistency
- **WHEN** running format tasks in default or lint environment
- **THEN** taplo version SHALL be identical across environments

### Requirement: Visual test targets build unconditionally
The build system SHALL build all visual test clients and the image comparison library as part of the default build, since all dependencies (wayland-client, wayland-protocols, stb_image, Catch2) are already project requirements.

#### Scenario: Default build includes visual targets
- **GIVEN** a clean CMake configuration using any preset
- **WHEN** the build completes
- **THEN** all test client binaries (`solid_color_client`, `gradient_client`, `quadrant_client`, `multi_surface_client`) SHALL be built
- **AND** `goggles_image_compare` CLI binary SHALL be built
- **AND** the `image_compare` static library SHALL be built
- **AND** `test_image_compare` Catch2 test binary SHALL be built

### Requirement: CTest label taxonomy
The build system SHALL register test targets under a consistent label taxonomy using `set_tests_properties(... LABELS ...)`.

#### Scenario: Unit label unchanged
- **WHEN** `ctest -L unit` is run with any preset
- **THEN** existing Catch2 unit tests and `image_compare_unit_tests` SHALL run
- **AND** no integration tests SHALL be included

#### Scenario: Integration label includes headless smoke
- **WHEN** `ctest -L integration` is run with any preset
- **THEN** the headless pipeline smoke test (`headless_smoke`, `headless_smoke_png_check`) SHALL be included
- **AND** existing integration tests (e.g., `auto_input_forwarding`, when available) SHALL also be included

#### Scenario: Visual label for visual regression tests
- **WHEN** `ctest -L visual` is run with any preset
- **THEN** only visual regression test targets (Phase 2+) SHALL run
- **AND** unit and integration tests SHALL NOT be included unless also labeled `visual`

### Requirement: Deterministic Semgrep Tooling

The build system SHALL provide a Pixi-managed Semgrep toolchain and checked-in rule source so local and CI static analysis use the same deterministic inputs.

#### Scenario: Pixi provides Semgrep for local and CI execution
- **GIVEN** the repository defines lint and developer workflow tooling in `pixi.toml`
- **WHEN** contributors or CI invoke the Semgrep entrypoint
- **THEN** the Semgrep binary SHALL come from the repository-managed Pixi environment
- **AND** the same Semgrep version surface SHALL be used locally and in CI

#### Scenario: Semgrep provenance is observable during verification
- **GIVEN** the repository verifies the Semgrep tool surface before enforcing the gate
- **WHEN** maintainers inspect the Semgrep path and version under the repository-managed workflow
- **THEN** the resolved Semgrep executable SHALL originate from the Pixi-managed environment
- **AND** the reported version SHALL match the locked local and CI Semgrep surface

#### Scenario: Pixi source-of-truth files stay synchronized
- **GIVEN** the repository adds Semgrep to the Pixi-managed tool surface
- **WHEN** the change updates Semgrep dependency configuration
- **THEN** `pixi.toml` SHALL declare the dependency version surface
- **AND** `pixi.lock` SHALL be updated in sync with that change

#### Scenario: Dependency admission remains reviewable
- **GIVEN** the repository adds Semgrep as a new dependency for the static-analysis workflow
- **WHEN** the proposal and apply artifacts are reviewed
- **THEN** they SHALL include dependency rationale, license compatibility review, maintenance assessment, and team agreement evidence
- **AND** the dependency SHALL NOT be treated as implicitly admitted just because the tool is easy to install

#### Scenario: Initial scan roots stay limited to repository-managed C and C++ code
- **GIVEN** the repository enables Semgrep policy checks
- **WHEN** the `pixi run semgrep` entrypoint runs in its initial configuration
- **THEN** it SHALL scan repository-managed code under `src/` and `tests/`
- **AND** it SHALL use narrower path filters for rules that apply only to selected subsystems

#### Scenario: Semgrep rule sources are checked into the repository
- **GIVEN** the repository enables Semgrep policy checks
- **WHEN** the Semgrep entrypoint runs
- **THEN** it SHALL load configuration and rules from checked-in repository files
- **AND** it SHALL NOT depend on registry defaults or hosted rule configuration

#### Scenario: Subsystem-sensitive rules stay path-scoped
- **GIVEN** some policy bans only apply to selected Goggles subsystems
- **WHEN** the repository defines Semgrep rules for Vulkan API split or render-path threading
- **THEN** those rules SHALL scope to the directories where the policy applies
- **AND** they SHALL exclude directories with explicit policy exceptions such as `src/capture/vk_layer/`

### Requirement: Normalized Filter Library Source Selection

The build system SHALL provide `goggles-filter-chain` as a stable Goggles consumer target contract
independent of whether the implementation is resolved from in-tree sources, a local subdirectory
provider, or the monorepo package/install rehearsal path.

#### Scenario: Goggles provider modes share target identity
- GIVEN Goggles is configured once with `in-tree`, once with `subdir`, and once with `package`
  provider selection
- WHEN downstream render targets link the filter runtime
- THEN each configuration SHALL provide the target name `goggles-filter-chain`
- AND downstream Goggles CMake code SHALL NOT branch on provider-specific target names

#### Scenario: Provider module normalizes external target names
- GIVEN an external provider exposes a namespaced or differently named target
- WHEN Goggles resolves that provider
- THEN the provider module SHALL normalize it to a local target named `goggles-filter-chain`
- AND downstream Goggles targets SHALL continue linking the normalized target name

### Requirement: Monorepo Package Rehearsal Preserves Goggles Workflows

The build system SHALL support a monorepo rehearsal where Goggles installs and then consumes the
filter-chain boundary through `package` mode without requiring ad-hoc build directories or non-preset
workflows.

#### Scenario: Preset-driven rehearsal remains available
- GIVEN Pixi tasks and named CMake presets are the supported workflow surface
- WHEN maintainers rehearse the package consumer path
- THEN the rehearsal SHALL run through repository-managed presets and task wrappers
- AND the workflow SHALL remain compatible with Goggles developer and CI conventions

#### Scenario: Installed rehearsal stays scoped to Goggles consumption
- GIVEN the package rehearsal installs boundary headers and config files inside the monorepo build
  tree
- WHEN Goggles consumes that install tree
- THEN the rehearsal SHALL prove Goggles can consume the normalized target and header surface
- AND it SHALL NOT by itself imply external downstream readiness beyond Goggles

### Requirement: Filter Runtime Test Registration Split

The build and test workflow SHALL distinguish reusable filter-chain contract coverage from Goggles
host/backend coverage.

#### Scenario: Contract and host coverage stay separately identifiable
- GIVEN automated test targets are registered for filter-chain behavior
- WHEN maintainers inspect the test graph
- THEN reusable contract coverage SHALL remain separately identifiable from Goggles host/backend
  coverage
- AND the split SHALL preserve clear ownership of boundary behavior versus host behavior

#### Scenario: Package consumer keeps host coverage active
- GIVEN Goggles is configured in `package` provider mode for the monorepo rehearsal
- WHEN tests are registered in that consumer build
- THEN Goggles host/backend coverage SHALL remain executable against the normalized consumer boundary
- AND reusable contract coverage MAY remain attached to the in-tree authored boundary target
