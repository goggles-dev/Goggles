# Input Forwarding

## Purpose

Explains how Goggles forwards input (keyboard, mouse) from the viewer window to captured applications without requiring window focus switching. Supports both X11 (via XWayland) and native Wayland applications.

## Problem

When running a target application inside the nested compositor, the app renders to a virtual display. Users want to control the target app by pressing keys in the Goggles viewer window, but standard input methods don't work because:

1. The target app is connected to the nested compositor's display server, not the host
2. X11/Wayland don't forward events between unrelated windows
3. Synthetic events (XTest, uinput) are filtered by many applications (especially Wine)

## Solution Architecture

### Component Overview

    X11Client["X11 client (XWayland)<br/>(DISPLAY=:N)"]
  end

```

### Unified Input via wlr_seat

The compositor uses wlroots' `wlr_seat_*` APIs to deliver input to focused surfaces:

- **Keyboard**: `wlr_seat_keyboard_notify_key()` sends key events
- **Pointer**: `wlr_seat_pointer_notify_motion/button/axis()` sends pointer events
- **Frame**: `wlr_seat_pointer_notify_frame()` groups related events

For XWayland apps, `wlr_xwayland_set_seat()` connects the seat to XWayland. The wlr_xwm (X Window Manager) automatically translates seat events to X11 KeyPress/KeyRelease and ButtonPress/MotionNotify events.

### Why Headless wlroots?

The nested Wayland compositor uses `wlr_headless_backend_create()` which:

- Creates Wayland sockets (`goggles-N`, `DISPLAY=:N`) without requiring GPU/display
- Doesn't conflict with the host compositor (Wayland/X11)
- Provides the minimal infrastructure for XWayland and native Wayland clients
- No actual composition or rendering happens

## Data Flow

### Initialization

1. **Goggles starts** → `goggles::input::CompositorServer::create()`
2. **Create headless Wayland compositor** on `goggles-N` socket
3. **Create seat** with keyboard and pointer capabilities
4. **Start XWayland** on DISPLAY=:N
5. **Connect XWayland to seat** via `wlr_xwayland_set_seat()`
6. **Register eventfd** for cross-thread input marshaling

### Runtime

1. **User presses W key** in Goggles SDL window
2. **SDL generates SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN** with scancode
3. **CompositorServer receives event** via SDL event loop
4. **Translate scancode** to Linux keycode (evdev)
5. **Push event to SPSCQueue** + write to eventfd
6. **Compositor thread wakes**, drains queue
7. **wlr_seat_keyboard_notify_key()** dispatches to focused surface
8. **For Wayland apps**: wl_keyboard.key sent directly
9. **For X11 apps**: wlr_xwm translates to X11 KeyPress/KeyRelease
10. **App processes input** as if from physical keyboard

### Shutdown

1. **Goggles exits** → terminate compositor
2. **Stop compositor event loop**
3. **Destroy XWayland, seat, backend**
4. **Close eventfd and cleanup**

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Unified wlr_seat_* API | Single code path for both X11 and Wayland apps |
| wlr_xwm for X11 translation | Proven wlroots component, no XTest dependency |
| SPSCQueue + eventfd | Lock-free cross-thread marshaling per project policy |
| Headless wlroots backend | No GPU/display conflict with host compositor |
| Auto-focus first surface | Focuses the first eligible surface |

## Thread Model

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Main as Main thread (SDL)
  participant Comp as Compositor thread (wl_display_run)

  Main->>Main: Poll SDL events
  Main->>Main: Translate to InputEvent
  Main->>Comp: Enqueue event (SPSC queue)
  Main->>Comp: Wake via eventfd

  Comp->>Comp: Drain queue
  Comp->>Comp: Deliver to focused surface
```

## Limitations

### Current Implementation

- **Basic mouse support**: Mouse button, motion, and wheel events forwarded. Coordinate mapping is 1:1 (no scaling).
- **Limited keycode map**: Common keys (A-Z, 0-9, ESC, Enter, Space, arrows, modifiers) mapped.
- **No modifier state tracking**: Shift/Ctrl/Alt forwarded as key events but state not synchronized.
- **Single app focus**: Auto-focuses first eligible surface (MVP).
- **XWayland surface cleanup**: No destroy listener for XWayland surfaces (fires unexpectedly). Stale pointers cleared during focus transitions.

### Focus Transition Behavior

- **Wayland app steals focus from X11**: When launching a Wayland app after an X11 app, focus automatically transfers. The X11 app's surface pointer may be stale (freed by wlroots) but is safely cleared.
- **X11 app does NOT steal focus from Wayland**: XWayland surfaces only gain focus if no surface is currently focused.

### Wayland Focus Timing

Wayland keyboard focus is granted after the client acks the initial xdg-shell configure (`xdg_surface.ack_configure`). This avoids gating focus on wlroots' `surface->events.map`, which may never occur for some Wayland-native Vulkan apps under WSI proxy mode (`GOGGLES_WSI_PROXY=1`).

### Future Enhancements

1. **Full keyboard map**: Complete SDL → Linux scancode translation
2. **Modifier state synchronization**: Track and sync Shift/Ctrl/Alt/Super state
3. **Mouse coordinate mapping**: Scale/transform coordinates for different window sizes
4. **Multi-app focus**: Input routing to specific windows

## Dependencies

Dependencies are provided by the Pixi environment (see `pixi.toml`) and a pinned wlroots package:

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| wlroots | 0.19 | Wayland compositor library (headless backend, seat, XWayland) |
| wayland-server | Pixi | Wayland protocol server implementation |
| xkbcommon | Pixi | Keyboard keymap handling for Wayland |
| SDL3 | Pixi | Viewer window input source |

**Note:** We do not inject via XTest/uinput. X11 clients receive input via wlroots' XWayland integration (`wlr_xwm` translating seat events to X11 events).

## Environment Variables

### Launching Captured Apps

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DISPLAY` | `:1` | Connect X11 app to XWayland (printed by Goggles on startup) |
| `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` | `goggles-0` | Connect Wayland app to nested compositor (printed by Goggles on startup) |

**Preferred:** Launch the target app through Goggles (default mode). Goggles will start the nested
compositor and set both `DISPLAY` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` for the target process automatically.

For X11 apps (including Wine):
```bash
WAYLAND_DISPLAY= DISPLAY=:1 ./my_x11_app
```

For Wayland-native apps:
```bash
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=goggles-0 ./my_wayland_app
```

## Testing

### Manual Test

```bash
# Launch test apps through Goggles (default mode sets DISPLAY/WAYLAND_DISPLAY automatically).
./build/debug/bin/goggles -- ./build/debug/tests/goggles_manual_input_x11
./build/debug/bin/goggles -- ./build/debug/tests/goggles_manual_input_wayland

# Focus Goggles window, press keys/move mouse
# test_app terminal should show input events
```

For a Wayland-native Vulkan app under WSI proxy (protocol focus sanity check):
```bash
DISPLAY=:1 WAYLAND_DISPLAY=goggles-0 WAYLAND_DEBUG=client GOGGLES_WSI_PROXY=1 GOGGLES_CAPTURE=1 \
  /home/kingstom/workspaces/vksdk/1.4.321.1/x86_64/bin/vkcube
```

### Verify XWayland Running

```bash
# Should show XWayland process on :N
ps aux | grep Xwayland

# Check nested display connections
DISPLAY=:1 xdotool search --class test
```
